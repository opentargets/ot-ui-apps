# How do I contribute?

üëçüéâ **First off, thanks for taking the time to read this and contribute!** üéâüëç

Open Targets follows the usual open-source project conventions for external contributions. Here is a quick rundown:

1. Find an [issue](https://github.com/opentargets/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afrontend) you are interested in addressing. Consider posting in the issue to inform us about your work.

2. Fork the relevant repository to your GitHub account. The [Development section](./README.md#running-development) of the readme provides more information on how to start the development environment.

3. Create a new branch for your work using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.

4. Work on your contribution. To stay on course with our best practices, be sure to read the [guidelines](#guidelines).

5. open a pull request (PR) when you are done. Follow the PR template to match our PR structure.

6. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.

7. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.

8. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!

## <a name="guidelines"></a> General guidelines for contributing

1. A PR must address a single issue or feature.
2. There must always be an issue number associated with the PR (in the title or description).
3. The branch should be rebased on `main` before opening the PR.
4. No changes to code not directly related to your PR.
5. Includes documentation.

**\*** This limitation is enforced on most PRs. A large feature or an issue that pertains to different logical units can have more than one commit, but the general rule is one issue per PR, one commit per PR.
