        We predict the consequence of variants (germline or somatic) on genes
        associated with diseases based on the evidence for the Genetic
        associations and Somatic mutation data types. This effect is defined by
        consequence terms from the Sequence Ontology (SO) project.

        The SO consequence terms, their descriptions and accession IDs are shown
        in the table below. The terms are shown in decreasing order of severity
        (from more severe to less severe) based on the functional score in
        Koscielny et al (Supplementary Table 2).
