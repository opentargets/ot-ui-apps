## End To End Test
The goal of this package is to setup automated E2E tests to check the platform web app for every pull request and against a new release.

## Page Object Model

This project uses the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to create maintainable and reusable test code. Our POM implementation is organized into three layers:

### 1. **Page Objects** (`POM/page/`)
High-level page abstractions that represent entire pages and provide navigation methods.

```typescript
// Example: VariantPage
class VariantPage {
  goToVariantPage(variantId: string) { ... }
  getProfilePage() { ... }
}
```

### 2. **Component Objects** (`POM/objects/components/`)
Reusable UI components that appear across multiple pages (headers, evidence sections, etc.).

```typescript
// Example: EvidenceSection
class EvidenceSection {
  waitForSectionLoad(sectionId: string) { ... }
  isEvidenceSectionVisible(sectionId: string) { ... }
}
```

### 3. **Widget Objects** (`POM/objects/widgets/`)
Feature-specific, interactive components with complex behavior (tables, forms, drawers).

```typescript
// Example: AotfTable
class AotfTable {
  getDataCellsWithScores(rowIndex: number) { ... }
  clickDataCell(rowIndex: number, columnId: string) { ... }
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Prefer `data-testid` attributes** over generic selectors (classes, XPath) for stability and readability
  ```typescript
  // ✅ Good - uses data-testid
  page.locator("[data-testid='evidence-section-gwas']")
  
  // ❌ Avoid - fragile CSS selectors
  page.locator(".MuiBox-root .css-8b1dmf")
  ```

- Keep selectors in Page Objects, not in test files
- Return Locators or primitives, avoid complex logic in Page Objects
- One file per component/page for clarity

For more details on POM, see the [References](#references) section.

## Testing Different Behaviours with Fixtures

We use **Playwright fixtures** to manage test data and make tests flexible and maintainable. All test entity IDs are centralized in `fixtures/testConfig.ts`.

### Configuration Structure

```typescript
interface TestConfig {
  drug: {
    primary: string;              // Drug with comprehensive data
  };
  variant: {
    primary: string;              // Variant with GWAS data
    withMolecularStructure: string;
    withPharmacogenomics: string;
  };
  disease: {
    primary: string;
    name?: string;
    aotfGenes?: string[];         // Genes for AOTF table testing
  };
  study: {
    gwas: { primary: string };
    qtl?: { primary: string };
  };
}
```

### Using Fixtures in Tests

```typescript
test("Disease header is correctly displayed", async ({ page, testConfig }) => {
  // Use testConfig instead of hardcoded IDs
  await page.goto(`/disease/${testConfig.disease.primary}`);
  
  const diseaseName = page.getByTestId("profile-page-header-text");
  await expect(diseaseName).toHaveText(testConfig.disease.name);
});
```

### Benefits

- **Single source of truth** for test data
- **Easy to update** entity IDs without touching test files
- **Test different scenarios** by swapping configurations
- **Supports future external config** (API, environment variables)

## Annotating Critical Tests

We use Playwright's tagging system to identify **smoke tests** - critical tests that must pass before running the full suite.

### Marking Smoke Tests

Add `{ tag: '@smoke' }` to critical tests that validate core functionality:

```typescript
test("Homepage loads successfully", { tag: '@smoke' }, async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  const title = await page.title();
  expect(title).toBe("Open Targets Platform");
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn dev:test:platform:e2e

# Run smoke tests only (fast feedback)
yarn dev:test:platform:e2e:smoke

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/pages/homepage.spec.ts
```

### CI Behavior

- **Pull Requests**: Automatically run smoke tests only (faster CI)
- **Manual Trigger**: Choose between `smoke` or `all` tests in GitHub Actions

## Testing Pattern
- User flow based testing
- [Page Object Model](https://testomat.io/blog/page-object-model-pattern-javascript-with-playwright/)

## How to setup
- `yarn install`
- `yarn playwright install` (to install playwright browser dependencies)
- `yarn dev:test:platform:e2e` (to run the test locally)
- `cd ./packages/platform-test && npx playwright test --ui ` (To run the tests in UI mode)

## Notes on Testing Github Workflow Locally

The workflow can be tested locally by installing [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

To test the workflow:
- Install act: Follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/nektos/act
- Run the `test_workflow` script to execute the GitHub workflow locally
